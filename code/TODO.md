# TODO: Implement Connect Button Functionality

- [x] Edit `code/components/navigation.tsx` to add onClick handler to the Connect button that opens the Google Form in a new tab.
- [ ] Start the Next.js development server using `pnpm dev`.
- [ ] Use browser_action to launch the local server, navigate to the page, and test the Connect button by clicking it to ensure it opens the Google Form.
