# Srivastav — Personal Portfolio

This repository contains my personal portfolio website built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS and a small set of UI components.

Quick start

```powershell
cd e:\\PROJECTS\\PORTFOLIO\\code
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

What this is

- A collection of small, focused React components (Hero, About, Projects, Contact).
- A Next.js app using the App Router and TypeScript.

If you want me to change any copy, add a project, or wire up a contact backend, tell me what text and links you'd like and I’ll update it.
